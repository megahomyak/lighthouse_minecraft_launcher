"lighthouse" is a Linux-only (at the moment) CLI Minecraft launcher.

USAGE:
* Install all the necessary dependencies (currently messy, figure this out by running the program and seeing what fails, read on to learn about running)
* Run the program (`python install.py`) to display a list of versions
* Run the program with a version name as an argument to install that version into a directory named after that version. The version directory will be located under the current directory
* Run `run.sh` inside of the version directory
