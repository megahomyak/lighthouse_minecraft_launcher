"Lighthouse" is a small CLI Minecraft Launcher intended for tinkerers. It has no dependencies outside of Python's standard library.

USAGE:
* Go to the directory you'd like to use for storing launcher data
* `lighthouse-list` lists versions
* `lighthouse-ensure VERSION DIRECTORY` ensures that all files for VERSION are downloaded in DIRECTORY
* `lighthouse-run DIRECTORY` runs version from DIRECTORY
* `lighthouse-detach DIRECTORY` detaches version from DIRECTORY
* `lighthouse-fabricate DIRECTORY` installs Fabric (https://fabricmc.net) into DIRECTORY

TIPS:
* If your download fails on Windows and you want to retry it until it succeeds, use this in cmd:

```
:label
your_lighthouse_invocation_command || goto :label
```

* ...and if on Linux, use this in Bash:

```
until your_lighthouse_invocation_command; do :; done
```
