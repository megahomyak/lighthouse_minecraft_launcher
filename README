"Lighthouse" is a small CLI Minecraft Launcher intended for tinkerers.

USAGE:
* Download dependencies using `pip` (`pip install -r requirements.txt`; you may use a Python virtual environment for this)
* Go to the directory you'd like to use for storing launcher data
* `.../lighthouse.py list` lists versions
* `.../lighthouse.py ensure VERSION` ensures that all files for VERSION are downloaded
* `.../lighthouse.py run VERSION` runs VERSION
